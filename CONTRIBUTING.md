# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines and steps for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please read it before contributing.

## Our CI/CD Pipeline

We use several tools to ensure code quality and security. Here's what happens when you make changes:

### 1. Code Quality Checks

* **ESLint**: Checks your code for errors and style issues
* **Prettier**: Makes your code look consistent
* **TypeScript**: Makes sure your types are correct

### 2. Security Checks

* **CodeQL**: Looks for security problems in your code
* **Snyk**: Checks for security issues in dependencies
* **Dependabot**: Keeps dependencies up to date

### 3. Performance Checks

* **Lighthouse**: Measures how fast and accessible your changes are
* **Bundle Size**: Makes sure the app stays small and fast

### 4. Testing

* **Unit Tests**: Makes sure individual parts work correctly
* **Integration Tests**: Checks if everything works together
* **E2E Tests**: Tests the whole app like a real user

### 5. Monitoring

* **Grafana Metrics**: Tracks important numbers about our app
* **Error Tracking**: Watches for problems in production
* **Usage Analytics**: Helps us understand how people use the app

## How to Make Changes

1. **Start Fresh**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
   Example: `git checkout -b fix/login-button`

2. **Make Your Changes**
   * Write your code
   * Test it locally
   * Add comments to explain complex parts

3. **Check Your Work**
   ```bash
   npm run lint        # Check for code problems
   npm run format      # Fix code formatting
   npm test           # Run tests
   npm run build      # Make sure it builds
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: short description"
   ```
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   Then go to GitHub and create a Pull Request

## What Happens Next?

1. **Automatic Checks** (about 5-10 minutes)
   * Green check = Good to go
   * Red X = Something needs fixing
   * Yellow dot = Still running

2. **Code Review**
   * At least one team member will review
   * They might suggest changes
   * Make changes if needed

3. **Merging**
   * All checks must pass
   * Need at least one approval
   * PR will be merged to main

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Checks Failed"

1. Click the "Details" link
2. Look at what failed
3. Fix the problem
4. Push your changes

### "Merge Conflicts"

1. Get the latest main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-branch
   git merge main
   ```
2. Fix any conflicts
3. Push your changes

### "Branch Out of Date"

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
git push origin your-branch
```

Remember: It's okay to make mistakes! The CI/CD pipeline is here to help catch problems before they reach users.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks:
